**UFW rules used on Ubuntu Splunk server in this homelab**

# Allow SSH only from host
sudo ufw allow from **your host ip** to any port 22 proto tcp

# Deny all other SSH
sudo ufw deny 22/tcp

# Allow Splunk Web UI
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 8000 proto tcp

# Allow Splunk receiving port (forwarders)
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 9997 proto tcp

3. Key-based auth:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 (algorithim) -C **name of key** key
ssh-copy-id **username@serverip**

4. Restart SSH:
sudo systemctl restart ssh

# Show rules
sudo ufw status numbered

These are the necessary and appropriate firewall rules to allow ideal restriction for this lab and to be able to have just enough access to the tools we need accessing to without compromising/exposing ourselves too much
