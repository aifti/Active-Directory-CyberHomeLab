This is where we should talk about our original idea/plan, how this all started and why we chose an on prem solution for this project


Ideally I was thinking of doing this project on the cloud, but then I thought, man it would be really cool if I could host everything on my own without relying on some cloud software (even though the future is cloud ofc)
You can defintely do this on the cloud, however the drawback is having to pay your cloud provider of choice to host the servers you would like to run, and who knows.... what if you accidently forget to keep track of your servers and you get a massive bill in the thousands???? 

That wouldn't be fun....

So yeah... I decided to host this on my own, since my PC specs can handle it, so it's really up to you what you would like to do, if cloud is your way, then go ahead, if you have the means of doing this on-prem, I highly recommend it since it makes it more interactive and forces you to understand and realize how servers and endpoints actually communicate with each other, and especially on the networking side which this project goes heavily in-depth on!!!!

Enjoy!!!!!
